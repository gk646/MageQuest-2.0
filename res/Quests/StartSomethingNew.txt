Name:Start of something new
Reward:Gold,25:XP,50
Description:Stranded in what looks like a deep forest and with little to no memory of how you got there, you itch forward hoping to find answers.
Zone:Oasis
Level:0

PLAYER_THOUGHT:Where ... where am I? How did I get here. I just remember getting lost in the forest:Look around
GOTO:18,87:Look around:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Hmm ... a water stream. Would probably be smart to follow it for now:Follow the stream
OPTIONAL_POSITION:Follow the stream:13,70,0:30,72,1
PLAYER_THOUGHT:A little exploring shouldn't hurt, nobody...:Follow the stream
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Looks like the stream leads me down there. Well I cant jump... Gotta find another way:Follow the stream
*
GOTO:61,92:Follow the stream:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:This looks like a maze... How did this get here? Must be a joke of a powerful and especially bored mage*sigh*:Find a way through the maze
OPTIONAL_POSITION:Find a way through the maze:82,86,0:82,98,1:73,80,0
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Huh, wrong way...:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:This feels... right?:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:A chest - here? Almost feels like it was placed here on purpose. Well, here's hoping I'll find something useful:s
*
OPTIONAL_POSITION:Find a way through the maze:88,95,0:94,95,0:78,80,0:98,76,1
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Nope...:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Ok, I should have seen that coming...:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Another chest... That cant be a coincidence. Buuut, then again do I really care?:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Finally - About time I get out of that. I should find that stream again. Can't afford to get lost - AGAIN...:s
*
OPTIONAL_POSITION:Find your way back to the stream:90,65,0:67,66,1
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Broken down - Of course. Then again all this looks abandoned for a long time:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Hey, that's the stream I saw earlier:s
*
GOTO:67,66:Find the stream:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Hmm ... a water stream. Would probably be smart to follow it for now:Follow the stream
GOTO:44,43:Follow the stream:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Hmm, the path splits up. Let's be smart here... I should follow each direction for a bit and take the more promising one. Sound good? Sound good! - Who am I talking to?... I gotta get back!*sigh*:Pick a direction
OPTIONAL_POSITION:Pick a direction:46,38,0:65,35,1:28,29,0
PLAYER_THOUGHT:It is enchantingly beautiful here. How come I have never heard of this place? Well... if many people would know it, it'd probably not be beautiful for a long time no more. Think! I gotta think more...:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:This certainly looks promising. Is that a cave over there next to the water? Worth a check for sure, after all I might need some shelter if I don't find another way:s
PLAYER_THOUGHT:So I guess this just leads to more hills and away from the lake... I am not really the hiking type. Here's hoping the other direction is better...:s

PLAYER_THOUGHT:I guess I should check that out:Inspect the cave
GOTO:1,58:Explore the cave:Oasis_Cave
NPC_SAY:SATIRO
And who might you be?... You don't look - evil?
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:SATIRO:So ?:1
I am the incarnation of the devil himself!:*chuckles* And to think you have seen it all. Lucky for you, I know your not. You should be more careful in these dark times. Others won't hesitate to smite down evil.
I... I just remember waking up in this forest. *Tell it the rest of your story*:*You spot a look of disbelief* Being honest is a fading virtue, not held by many anymore.
I could ask you the same thing!:I am afraid I cant answer you for now. Just know that I won't harm you. I am seeking shelter in this cave just as you.
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:SATIRO: I might be able to help you in your predicament. I propose... How do you - Hmm, a favor for a favor!:0:MAJOR
A favor for a *sigh* - Sure I guess. What do you want?:Its simple enough... Bring me a - flower. A "magnificent" one! You should start your search the hillside across the lake. I felt something there while searching for a hiding spot.
Who, or what are you? How come your seeking shelter - here of all places?:Not all I can tell is made for mortal ears. Accept my offer, and you will receive what you seek in due time.

SPAWN:12,6:1,Oasis:3,10
GOTO:66,18:Leave the cave:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:So I guess I'll have to get that flower...:Go across the bridge to the hills
GOTO:27,28:Find the hills:Oasis
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Why am I doing this again? Right - cause it's my only way of getting out of here...:Find a "magnificent" flower
COLLECT:12,6:Find a "magnificent" flower
PLAYER_THOUGHT:Soo, the same way back... What does it want with a flower anyway?:Bring Satiro the flower
GOTO:6,54:Bring Satiro the flower:Oasis_Cave
REMOVE_ITEM:12,6:1
SPEAK:SATIRO:Wait for Satiro to return the favor:WAYPOINT,0,0:MAJOR
Thank you. Truly a beautiful flower don't you think? *smiles* It's more than just beautiful however...
*Satiros lips begin to move, muttering undiscernable words casting what appears to be some kind of ritual. You see the flower being consumed by a bright light, that splits up into thousands of golden string slowly wrapping around you.*
*Before you can even react, all the energy is absorbed by your body - strengthening you?*
Hmm,... this should have awakened something in you - the ability to call on the things between the worlds. You might know it as magic.
I felt it when you first walked in - radiating, but waiting for the moment to sprout.
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:SATIRO: It's a rare gift not many carry with them. It's up to you now what you make of it.:0
I heard about magic, but never seen it. The worlds between?:"The world between", is merely a phrase in your language used to transport an idea. The idea of a hidden plane of ethereal power, a world with unimaginable size and shape... but real. In you is the key, for your mind to access this new world.
So, can I shoot fireballs?:You're eager to learn. That's good... But your asking the wrong person. All you need is inside your mind... To answer your question, if you can shoot one, you can. If you cannot, you can't!
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:SATIRO:Many creatures draw power from this alternative plane, but all pale to its completeness, its perfection. It's easy to fall into a mindless hunger for more power, just to be consumed by its endless waves. You would call that "Go crazy"...:0
Can you teach me how to use my mind?:Even better! I will teach how, how to you learn by yourself! It will just give you the little push you need.
How:Not all I can tell is made for mortal ears. Accept my offer, and you will receive what you seek in due time.
