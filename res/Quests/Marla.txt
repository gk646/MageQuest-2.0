SPEAK:MARLA:Listen to Marla's story:WAYPOINT,0,0
Thank you, ill catch you up on what happened, but don't judge me!
You see, I recently "sold" a necklace. Well, I had some debts to pay off and the only valuable thing I have is an old magical necklace.
But it's a longtime family heirloom, I just couldn't bring myself to sell it. So I foolishly made a fake version and sold it to a traveler who passed through here.
It seemed like a good idea at first, but I realized too late that she wasn't just any ordinary traveler. She was an adventurer, like yourself, and now I'm worried she might catch on to the lie.
If she got in danger and die because of the useless necklace... But if you tell her the lie she might come back and threaten me!
You have to find her, and help me out of my situation.

CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:MARLA:I cant pay much but ill find something I am sure. Will you help me?:0:MAJOR
Sure, ill help you out:I was somehow convinced you would help me after I saw you...
Maybe later:I see how it is. You're not willing to help out a fellow traveler in need. I thought you were different, but I guess I was wrong.

CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:ARIA:Arrgh, those little pesky mushroom thingys. Hate em. So, yeah bla bla you helped me. Don't make me say it!:0
You couldn't have done it without me!:*Sigh*, okay. You can come along. I could definitely use the help with how dangerous everything got recently...
*
SPEAK:ARIA:Hear out Aria's plan
So, to stop being so secretive about this. I got a tip, about a hidden cave entrance leading to the mountain top. What will we find there? I hope treasure and riches, of course.
I think down here is the right path. I'll give you a sec to look around if you want. Man, speaking of, looks like these mushrooms got you bad. Here a little something for helping me fight them off.

CHOICE_DIALOGUE:ARIA:Sooo... Are you ready to go?
Yep, iam ready!:Let's go, eh, adventuring! ... ... Hey don't judge me on my oneliners!:-1
The necklace is fake! You got ripped of:I got... you better watch your tone. It's not like I this is my first time buying... Why do I even - come one before you have more stupid ideas.:-1

NPC_SAY:ARIA:SKIP
These woods are usually tame, except the occasional wolf pack here and there.

NPC_SAY:ARIA
Four statues and in such a shape, I doubt that's a coincidence. Maybe some kind of puzzle, but not what I came here to do. I'll wait over at the stairs if you wanna look around.

Come on now. I bet there's much cooler things on that mountain that those statues. Also, it's not like they are gonna run off...!

GOTO:89,62:Follow:Hillcrest
CHOICE_DIALOGUE:ARIA:You know what. This little pond looks like a nice wresting point. I could use a bit of a breather after all that fighting. What about you?
I was afraid you'd never ask! You got quite the pace:*chuckles*Yeah, didn't hear that for the first time. But you kept up quite good!:-1
Sure why not:Trust me, we will need to be rested for what's coming. I have a hunch there.:-1
Me a break! Seems like its just you that needs one!:Yeah don't get cocky. It's a nice place. Sometimes I just like to enjoy the scenery for a bit.:-1

NPC_MOVE:ARIA:Rest together with Aria:WAYPOINT,91,57:91,57
GOTO:91,57:Rest together with Aria:Hillcrest
SPEAK:ARIA:Listen to Aria:WAYPOINT,91,57
Isn't this peaceful? One of the many upsides of being an adventurer. Your outside, seeing natures in its purest form. Hearing the water stream, seeing the fish fight against the current...
But you never know whats coming. Danger, riches. Meeting new friends or making new enemies.
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE:ARIA:On another note, why do you do it? The adventuring? Are you out here for the danger, the treasure or the just friends you make along the way?
Danger is my second name!:I held you for more of a - treasure-seeking type. But I get it. The adrenaline, when you look each other in the face, well most of the time you can't call it face with these monsters...  But yeah, it's a special moment.:-1
Loot, loot, LOOT!:I knew it! Trust me I have seen enough people who want the same. But nothing wrong with wanting the shiniest, bestest, cleanest or fashioniest armour... Ok, that last one was a stretch.:-1
For the friends!:So the friends huh, wouldn't have guessed that. Most people I met out here are looking out for themselves and close down to strangers. Understandable if you got betrayed a couple of times, but my advice; Try to keep it like this.:-1
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:ARIA:...:0
What about you?:Hmm ... ... People dont often ask about me.
*
SPEAK:ARIA:Listen to Aria:WAYPOINT,91,57
I actually grew up not too far from here. There's this town in the heart of the GrassLands, Homestead. But back then everything here was different - for the better!
You know, no creatures would lurk for travelers on the road, nest in the woods. People were friendly and looking out for each other and so on.
Sometimes I wish back those memories, but to trade em against all my experiences I made in my lifetime, fighting, travelling and ... cooking - I also like cooking. But no, I don't regret my choices. I would probably do it again.
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:ARIA:Ha! This time the counter question for you - What's your story?:0
*Tell her about journey so far*:Hmm ... a traveler between worlds... force of darkness?
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:ARIA:You have one for telling stories, I'll admit so much!:0
It happened. It's real!:I never heard of anything even close to that. But seeing you use magic - makes your think...
*
CHOICE_DIALOGUE_SIMPLE:ARIA:Hey, almost forgot - we wanna reach that mountain remember? You rested and ready to go again?:0
Let's go:That's the spirit. Maybe you're useful after all. *chuckles* Just messing with you...
I wanna a bit longer:Fine, well wait one bit more. You're lucky the fish here are quite nice to watch...

NPC_SAY:ARIA
Good day Marla. How are you doing on this sunny day. Only thing better is buying a nice necklace for oneself don't you agree?
*
NPC_SAY:MARLA
You found out! I am so sorry, its just that the necklace is so important to me, but I needed the money. I hope you can understand and don't hurt me, I will give you the real necklace.
*
NPC_SAY:ARIA
You see, that's something you could have done already, right. I think it's only fair if I get, lets say 50 coins for my troubles.
I planned to use the necklaces power to help me fight off all kinds of things, I could have died because of you!
*
NPC_SAY:MARLA
You are right, you are right, here is the necklace. But ... but I don't have 50 coins. I really want to make it right!
*
NPC_SAY:ARIA
Well, looks to me, you can't. I don't wanna hurt you, there's enough bloodshed in the world these days. I'll just go my way, far away from here.
And I won't fail to tell everyone to turn there back on this cutthroat village! Good day madam! And to you, thanks for telling me maybe we will meet again one day in different, better circumstances.
